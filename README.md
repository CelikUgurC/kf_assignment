## There are three steps in my code blog:

1- Retrieve all outages and filter by older 01/01/2022

2- Retrieve site-info and take only devices information

3- Merge these two dataframes, order columns and convert df to json for posting


## There are four python libraries:
requests --> for get and post url

json --> fro reading json file

pandas --> for dataframe process

sys --> get parameter from user (for site_id and api-key)

## You can run this code blog like:

python post_outages.py site_id api-key

python post_outages.py norwich####### 2Y4B4NjPW77Zk6FJK3lL2########
